## Notes

When it comes to the winning conditions it seems that slot games can have additional extra rules or modes or bonuses where multiple lines might be
calculated towards the winnings. As per the email and configuration.ts file I am not sure how exactly to go about this.

When it comes to slot machines based on my 2 day experience winnings can be calculated both ONLY if winnings lines are encountered and also if a certain number of symbols are shown more than X times. So I am confused: D

I guess it comes down to whether we want to keep the person hoping psychologically so he/she/they can lose more money at the game. Just thinking.

I thought I had a good idea with the notion that if you sum 1 five times and then module 5 == 0 then these are all the same numbers but that is not the case: )

### Questions

What if given the winning lines we get a slot spin where there are more than five 1s or more than five 2s? As far as I understand the rules we are anticipating that we there will never be more than 5?
